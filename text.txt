Hare Krishna
The BVC Bootcamp was an experience of its own as there were great teachers like ansh pr.,saagar pr.,bhavya pr.
It was an great time learning python and its libraries.I really liked the matplotlib part as like it showed how some code could show graphs and data in a vibrant manner.
One of the many things that i liked was the thing that the bootcamp taught us things from the fundamentals as some of us had no prior experience in coding.
Overall it was a good time learning python.
