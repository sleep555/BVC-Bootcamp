# BVC-Bootcamp
Hare Krishna
The evening sessions were amazing as they were full of knowledge and experiences .
Some sessions of Pr Gururaj Vishwanath were truly extraordinary .
Hearing from past alumnis was an experience of its own.
The main things that I liked were the teachings on how to do one's routine daily and how to be kind to others.
